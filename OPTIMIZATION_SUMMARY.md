## ✅ BITCOIN DASHBOARD RESPONSIVENESS OPTIMIZATIONS

### **Issues Fixed:**
1. **"main.py is not responding" warning** - Caused by blocking operations during startup
2. **Slow UI initialization** - Heavy operations were blocking the main thread
3. **Cryptographic operations blocking startup** - Address generation was synchronous

### **Optimizations Applied:**

#### **1. Deferred Service Initialization**
- **main.py**: Heavy operations now run after UI is shown
  - FastAPI server startup: Deferred by 100ms
  - Peer registration: Deferred by 200ms  
  - Service startup: Deferred by 500ms
  - Cloudflared: Deferred by 1000ms

#### **2. Asynchronous Bitcoin Service Setup**
- **MainWindow**: Bitcoin address operations deferred to prevent blocking
  - Address generation moved to background after UI load
  - All signal connections use `QueuedConnection` to prevent blocking
  - Bitcoin service initialization separated from UI creation

#### **3. Optimized Device Detection**
- **BitcoinService**: Fast device detection with timeouts
  - ARM architecture check first (fastest)
  - Memory check with 100ms timeout
  - Removed slow file I/O operations during startup

#### **4. Deferred UI Component Creation**
- **TransactionPage**: Tabs created progressively
  - Send tab created immediately (most important)
  - Other tabs deferred by 50ms
  - Transaction history loading deferred with timers

### **Results:**
- ✅ **UI appears immediately** - No more "not responding" warnings
- ✅ **Responsive interaction** - Users can navigate while services load
- ✅ **Progressive loading** - Heavy operations happen in background
- ✅ **Maintained functionality** - All Bitcoin features still work

### **Startup Sequence Now:**
1. **Immediate**: Qt app creation and main window display
2. **100ms**: FastAPI server starts in background
3. **200ms**: Peer registration begins
4. **500ms**: Meshtastic service starts
5. **1000ms**: Cloudflared tunnel creation

The dashboard now starts **instantly** and remains responsive while background services initialize progressively!
