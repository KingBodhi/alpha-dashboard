## ✅ TRANSACTION PAGE ERROR FIXED

### **Issue Resolved:**
```
⚠️ Failed to setup Bitcoin address: 'TransactionPage' object has no attribute 'receive_address_label'
```

### **Root Cause:**
The `receive_address_label` UI component was being accessed before it was created due to the deferred tab loading optimization. The UI components are now created progressively:

1. **Send tab** (immediate) - contains `balance_label`
2. **Receive tab** (50ms delay) - contains `receive_address_label` 
3. **History tab** (50ms delay)
4. **Builder tab** (50ms delay)

### **Solution Applied:**

#### **1. Safe UI Component Access**
- Added `hasattr()` checks before accessing UI components
- Store pending address in `_pending_address` for later application
- Apply updates when UI components become available

#### **2. Deferred Updates Application**
- Added `_apply_pending_updates()` method called after all tabs are created
- Ensures address and balance updates are applied once UI is ready

#### **3. Robust Error Handling**
- All balance/address update methods now check if UI components exist
- Graceful handling of timing between service setup and UI creation

### **Code Changes:**
```python
# Safe address setting with pending storage
def set_wallet_address(self, address, private_key_wif=None):
    self._pending_address = address  # Store for later
    if hasattr(self, 'receive_address_label'):
        self.receive_address_label.setText(address)

# Safe balance updates
def update_wallet_balance(self, address, balance_info):
    if hasattr(self, 'balance_label'):
        self.balance_label.setText(f"Balance: {balance:.8f} BTC")

# Apply pending updates after UI is ready
def _apply_pending_updates(self):
    if hasattr(self, '_pending_address') and hasattr(self, 'receive_address_label'):
        self.receive_address_label.setText(self._pending_address)
```

### **Result:**
✅ **No more startup errors**
✅ **Smooth progressive UI loading** 
✅ **Responsive startup maintained**
✅ **All Bitcoin functionality preserved**

The transaction page now handles the deferred loading gracefully while maintaining responsive startup performance!
