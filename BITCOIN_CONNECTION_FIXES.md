# Bitcoin Connection Fixes and Improvements

## Summary of Issues Fixed

This document outlines the critical fixes applied to the Bitcoin service to resolve connection, wallet compatibility, and timeout issues identified in the test logs.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Wallet Type Incompatibility
**Problem**: RPC error "Only legacy wallets are supported by this command"
- The service was trying to use `importaddress()` on descriptor wallets
- Descriptor wallets don't support address importing the same way as legacy wallets

**Root Cause**: Wallet type detection happened too late in the connection process

### 2. Excessive Disconnections
**Problem**: Service disconnecting after only 7-15 failures
- Too aggressive failure counting leading to premature disconnections
- Normal busy node behavior was treated as permanent failures

### 3. Poor Timeout Handling
**Problem**: Timeouts causing immediate disconnections instead of graceful degradation
- Balance checks timing out and causing service shutdown
- No distinction between temporary busy states and permanent failures

### 4. Address Monitoring Issues
**Problem**: Zero transactions found even for known addresses
- Address import failures preventing proper transaction detection
- No fallback mechanisms for descriptor wallets

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Wallet Type Detection Improvements

**File**: `services/bitcoin_service.py` (lines 237-242, 1291-1328)

**Changes**:
- Moved wallet type detection to occur **before** wallet loading
- Improved detection logic to handle edge cases
- Added fallback detection methods
- Default to descriptor wallet for safety with modern Bitcoin Core

```python
# Detect wallet type first (before other operations)
self._detect_wallet_type()

# Enhanced detection with multiple fallback methods
def _detect_wallet_type(self):
    # Try getwalletinfo first
    # Fallback to import test
    # Handle "no wallet" cases gracefully
    # Default to descriptor for modern compatibility
```

### 2. Address Import Compatibility

**File**: `services/bitcoin_service.py` (lines 640-652)

**Changes**:
- Only attempt `importaddress()` for legacy wallets
- Skip import for descriptor wallets (they don't need it)
- Added appropriate logging for each wallet type

```python
# Only import for legacy wallets
if self.is_connected and not self.is_descriptor_wallet:
    # Legacy wallet - import address
elif self.is_connected and self.is_descriptor_wallet:
    # Descriptor wallet - monitor without import
```

### 3. Resilient Failure Handling

**File**: `services/bitcoin_service.py` (lines 336-348, 520-530)

**Changes**:
- Increased failure thresholds from 15 to 25+ before warnings
- Only disconnect after 50+ consecutive failures
- Reduced logging spam from every 5th failure to every 10th
- Distinguish between busy node and actual connection failures

**Before**:
```python
if self._rpc_failure_count > 15:
    # Disconnect immediately
```

**After**:
```python
if self._rpc_failure_count > 25:
    # Warning only, continue trying
if self._rpc_failure_count > 50:
    # Actually disconnect after many more failures
```

### 4. Improved Timeout Management

**File**: `services/bitcoin_service.py` (lines 684-688)

**Changes**:
- Increased timeout thresholds for balance checks
- Better distinction between temporary delays and failures
- More conservative timeout handling for busy nodes

### 5. Enhanced Error Messages

**File**: `services/bitcoin_service.py` (various locations)

**Changes**:
- More informative status messages
- Reduced spam in logs
- Better user feedback about node state
- Clearer indication of wallet types and capabilities

## Testing Improvements

### New Test Script: `test_connection_improvements.py`

**Features**:
- Comprehensive testing of all fixed components
- Better error handling verification
- Wallet type detection testing
- Resilience testing
- Detailed result reporting

**Test Coverage**:
1. Connection with improved error handling
2. Wallet type detection
3. Address monitoring compatibility
4. Balance checking with timeout handling
5. Data updates with busy node handling
6. Connection resilience testing

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

### 1. Descriptor Wallets
- ✅ No more "Only legacy wallets supported" errors
- ✅ Proper wallet type detection
- ✅ Address monitoring without import attempts
- ✅ Balance checking works correctly

### 2. Connection Resilience
- ✅ Service stays connected during temporary node busy periods
- ✅ Graceful degradation instead of disconnection
- ✅ Reduced log spam during busy periods
- ✅ Better timeout handling

### 3. Address Monitoring
- ✅ Works with both legacy and descriptor wallets
- ✅ Proper balance checking for all wallet types
- ✅ Transaction detection improvements
- ✅ Better performance status reporting

### 4. Error Handling
- ✅ More informative error messages
- ✅ Distinction between temporary and permanent issues
- ✅ Better user feedback
- ✅ Reduced console spam

## Compatibility

### Bitcoin Core Versions
- ✅ Bitcoin Core 0.21+ (descriptor wallets)
- ✅ Bitcoin Core 0.17+ (legacy wallets)
- ✅ Testnet and mainnet
- ✅ Local and remote nodes

### Wallet Types
- ✅ Descriptor wallets (modern)
- ✅ Legacy wallets (traditional)
- ✅ Mixed environments
- ✅ No wallet loaded scenarios

## Performance Improvements

### Reduced Resource Usage
- Fewer unnecessary RPC calls during busy periods
- Smarter retry logic
- Better timeout scaling
- Reduced logging overhead

### Better User Experience
- More responsive UI during node busy periods
- Clearer status messages
- Fewer false disconnections

- Track success rates over time

### Features
- Enhanced transaction detection for descriptor wallets
- Better fee estimation fallbacks
- Improved batch operations for multiple addresses
